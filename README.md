HomeChain will be financial marketplace that facilitates the sale and purchase of real estate on a global scale. These purchases and sales will not be based on current market values but to a value of up to 50% discount which will enable our younger generation in all parts of the world the opportunity to own their own home.
In order to accomplish this goal our first step is building a universal wallet that will be capable of storing the most popular crypto-currencies and any ERC-20 token.
Our wallet will be capable of storing any number of different crypto-currencies.
We will then begin building our marketplace and user interface.
They will the use our user interface and the token Genesis (GEN) to interact with the HomeChain.
The UI will allow users to invest into upcoming projects, land purchases and community builds. A voting system will allow communities and investors to implement technologies into the construction, running and maintenance of homes and being rewarded for successful implementation of those services.
By making our home community profiles public potential buyers can find communities with similar interests or backgrounds further solidifying your community as a whole.
